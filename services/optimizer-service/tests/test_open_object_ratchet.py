"""Open-object ratchet for the optimizer's published surface — the Python half of
edge-gateway's SpecOpenObjectRatchetTest, same rules, same location grammar.

No response may contain an UNCONSTRAINED OPEN OBJECT (``type: object`` with no ``properties``,
``additionalProperties`` of ``{}``/``true``, or the empty schema ``{}``) outside a named frozen
exemption. A consumer reading one learns nothing: every key is legal, no key is promised, and
ci-contracts' breaking gate has nothing to diff, so adding / renaming / removing a key inside it
is a silent wire change.

WHY THIS LIVES HERE RATHER THAN IN THE JAVA RATCHET. Cross-vendor review on #1196 falsified the
premise that let this service be waved through: the Java test excluded it as "inherently free-form
parameter bags", but ``api.py`` ``run`` returns exactly ``{jobId, status}`` and ``cancel`` exactly
``{status}`` — fixed shapes declared ``dict[str, Any]``. Two homes were possible and the choice is
not cosmetic:

* the committed ``contracts/optimizer-service.openapi.json`` from the Java test — but this is the
  ONE service with no source-side instrument at all (MapReturnRatchetTest's regex cannot read
  Python) and a HAND-DUMPED spec, so a new ``dict[str, Any]`` endpoint would sit unguarded until
  somebody re-dumped;
* ``app.openapi()``, generated from the code every run — no staleness window, and it fails in the
  language of whoever broke it.

The second is the only one that actually closes the gap, so this file exists and the Java test's
OUT_OF_SCOPE entry points at it.

GRANULARITY, and the defect it fixes. Freezing COMPONENT NAMES lets one line authorise unlimited
new uses of that component. The unit here is therefore where opacity is WRITTEN INTO the schema
graph — an inline open object at the spot it is written, and a ``$ref`` to an already-open
component at the REFERENCING SITE. Full per-location expansion was measured and rejected: it
re-reaches ``ErrorEnvelope.details`` through every operation's error response.

BLIND SPOTS, stated because a future session will trust this docstring: this sees only what
``app.openapi()`` enumerates, so a route excluded from the schema (``include_in_schema=False``) is
invisible here; and it is scoped to RESPONSES — request bodies are deliberately out, since the
question is what we PUBLISH. ci-optimizer is path-filtered, so this runs when optimizer code
changes, which is exactly when a new open response can appear.
